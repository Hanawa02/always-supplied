# Feature: Shopping List Page

## Story

As a user I want to see a list of supply items that I need to buy, I also want to be able to add, edit or remove the items.

I want to be able to add items to my shopping list from the supply configuration page.

## Scope

- Data should be stored in our indexedDb (also using dexie)
- Modern and appealing UI
- user should be able to define the quantity to buy, and use a different shopping hint from the one in the supply configuration item
- to avoid confusion, let's call the supply item to be bough as buying item, and leave supply item as the term for the configuration part
- the user should be able to hide the items already marked as bought
