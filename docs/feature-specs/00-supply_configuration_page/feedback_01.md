# Feedback 01

## UI Issues

- in mobile view, the Page title and "add supply item" gets squashed together, maybe it would be better to have the font smaller or put them stacked vertically instead of horizontally
- I can't see an icon for the button to add preferred brands

## Functionality issues

- When I click on "Create Item" in the Add supply item popup, I get the error: "Uncaught ReferenceError: emit is not defined at handleSubmit (SupplyItemModal.vue:260:5)"
- I did not find out how to delete or edit items

## General things

- I got a bit confused because some of the categories overlap with the storage room options, maybe it would be better to remove or change the categories that overlap
