# Feature: Cloud storage and Information sharing

## Story

As a user I want to have my share my list with other people.

I want to be able to add people to my supplied building, so they can have access to the same shopping list and supply configuration.

## Scope

- User should be able to login or create an account
- Users should still be able to use the app without login/account
- User should be able to share their supplied building, and all information from the building (shopping list items and supply configuration)
- Any action done to a supplied building or it's information should be synced and kept up-to-date with all members of the supplied building
- sharing and sync of the supplied building can only be done with an account
