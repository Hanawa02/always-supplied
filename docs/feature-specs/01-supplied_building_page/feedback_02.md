- Let's improve the UX:
  - when the user select's to manage a building, we should keep that information, so that if they click on the "Supply Configuration" menu in the nav bar, we take them to the last selected building's supply config
    - you can use a pinia store to keep this information
    - update the navigation bar so that the selected building name's shown
  - make the navigation bar mobile friendly, for example on mobile we could have a hamburger menu, and the navigation itself in a drawer
    - feel free to check what are the common standards for that
