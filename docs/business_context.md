# Always Supplied

An app to manage supply's in a collaborative manner, without the overhead of remembering everything your house would normally need. You could say it's a fancy grocery list that also stores the things you need in your house and not only what you need to buy.

## Supply Configuration

The supply configuration is the list of all supply items the user expects to be stocked in their Supply Building.

### Supply item

## Supplied Building

The supplied building is the physical building where the supplies are used and stored. The building has one or more rooms (storage rooms), and the supplies are distributed between them.

Examples of supply building: a family's house, a company's office.

### Storage Room

A storage room is a physical room where the supply is stored.

Examples of supply rooms: bathroom, kitchen, storehouse, manager's office room.

## Members

A supply building can be used by multiple people, we call them members. Members collaborate to keep the supplies in stock, by either registering items that need to be supplied or bought.

## Shopping History
